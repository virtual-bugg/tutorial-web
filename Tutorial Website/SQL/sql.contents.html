   <h1> Overview of the SQL Query Language</h1>
IBM developed the original version of SQL, originally called Sequel, as part of the
System R project in the early 1970s. The Sequel language has evolved since then,
and its name has changed to SQL (Structured Query Language). Many products
now support the SQL language. SQL has clearly established itself as the standard
relational database language.
In 1986, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) published an SQL standard, called
SQL-86. ANSI published an extended standard for SQL, SQL-89, in 1989. The next version of the standard was SQL-92 standard, followed by SQL:1999, SQL:2003, SQL:2006,
and most recently SQL:2008. The bibliographic notes provide references to these
standards.
<br><br>
<h4>The SQL language has several parts:</h4>
<b>•</b> Data-definition language (DDL). The SQL DDL provides commands for defining relation schemas, deleting relations, and modifying relation schemas.
<br><b>•</b> Data-manipulation language (DML). The SQL DML provides the ability to
query information from the database and to insert tuples into, delete tuples
from, and modify tuples in the database.
<br><b>•</b> Integrity. The SQL DDL includes commands for specifying integrity constraints that the data stored in the database must satisfy. Updates that violate
integrity constraints are disallowed.
<br><b>•</b> View definition. The SQL DDL includes commands for defining views.
<br><b>•</b> Transaction control. SQL includes commands for specifying the beginning
and ending of transactions.
<br><b>•</b> Embedded SQL and dynamic SQL. Embedded and dynamic SQL define how
SQL statements can be embedded within general-purpose programming languages, such as C, C++, and Java.
<br><b>•</b> Authorization. The SQL DDL includes commands for specifying access rights
to relations and views
<br><br>



<h1>Basic Types
</h1>The SQL standard supports a variety of built-in types, including:
<br><b>• char(n): </b> A fixed-length character string with user-specified length n. The full
form, character, can be used instead.
<br><b>• varchar(n): </b>A variable-length character string with user-specified maximum
length n. The full form, character varying, is equivalent.
<br><b>• int: </b> An integer (a finite subset of the integers that is machine dependent). The
full form, integer, is equivalent.
<br><b>• smallint: </b>A small integer (a machine-dependent subset of the integer type).
<br><b>• numeric(p, d): </b> A fixed-point number with user-specified precision. The number consists of p digits (plus a sign), and d of the p digits are to the right of
the decimal point. Thus, numeric(3,1) allows 44.5 to be stored exactly, but
neither 444.5 or 0.32 can be stored exactly in a field of this type.
<br><b>• real, double precision: </b>Floating-point and double-precision floating-point
numbers with machine-dependent precision.
<br><b>• float(n): </b>A floating-point number, with precision of at least n digits.
<br><br>



<h1>Creating Tables</h1>
We define an SQL relation by using the create table command. The following
command creates a relation department in the database.
<br><br>
<h4>create table department <br>
    (dept name varchar (20),<br>
    building varchar (15),<br>
    budget numeric (12,2), <br>
    primary key (dept name));</h4>
<br><br>
The relation created above has three attributes, dept name, which is a character
string of maximum length 20, building, which is a character string of maximum
length 15, and budget, which is a number with 12 digits in total, 2 of which are
after the decimal point. The create table command also specifies that the dept
name attribute is the primary key of the department relation.
<br><br>
The semicolon shown at the end of the create table statements, as well as
at the end of other SQL statements later in this chapter, is optional in many SQL
implementations.
<br><br>




<h1>Inserting Data</h1>
A newly created relation is empty initially. We can use the insert command
to load data into the relation. 
<br><br>
<h4>
    Syntax: <br>
    insert into table_name <br>
    values (....); <br><br>
    The values are specified in the order in which the corresponding attributes are
listed in the relation schema<br><br>
    or <br><br>
    insert into table_name <br>
    clo1, col2, col3... <br>
    values (val1,val2,val3....) <br><br>
    For Example <br>
</h4>
<h4>insert into instructor <br>
    values (10211, ’Smith’, ’Biology’, 66000);</h4>
<br><br>




<h1>Deletion of data</h1>
We can use the delete command to delete tuples from a relation. The command would delete all tuples from the student relation. Other forms of the delete command allow specific tuples to be deleted<br><br>
<h4>Syntax: <br>
    selete from table_name <br></h4>
    <br>
    To remove a relation from an SQL database, we use the drop table command.
The drop table command deletes all information about the dropped relation from
the database. The command <br><br>
<h4>drop table r;</h4>
<br>
is a more drastic action than <br>
<h4>delete from r;</h4> <br><br>
The latter retains relation r, but deletes all tuples in r. The former deletes not only
all tuples of r, but also the schema for r. After r is dropped, no tuples can be
inserted into r unless it is re-created with the create table command.
<br><br>



<h1>Updation of relation</h1>
We use the alter table command to add attributes to an existing relation. All
tuples in the relation are assigned null as the value for the new attribute. The form
of the alter table command is <br><br>
<h4>alter table r add A D;</h4> <br>
where r is the name of an existing relation, A is the name of the attribute to be
added, and D is the type of the added attribute. We can drop attributes from a
relation by the command <br><br>
<h4>alter table r drop A;</h4> <br>
where r is the name of an existing relation, and A is the name of an attribute of the
relation. Many database systems do not support dropping of attributes, although
they will allow an entire table to be dropped <br><br>



<h1>Querying Tables</h1>
The basic structure of an SQL query consists of three clauses: select, from, and
where. The query takes as its input the relations listed in the from clause, operates
on them as specified in the where and select clauses, and then produces a relation
as the result. <br><br>
<h4>Syntax <br>
Select col_names or *</h4>(to consider all the colums of a given relation) <h4> from table_name</h4>
<br><br>
Now consider a query, “Find the department names of all instructors,”<br>
which can be written as: 
<br><br>
select dept name
from instructor;
<br><br>
<h4> -> Distinct keyword</h4>
In those cases where we want to force the elimination of duplicates, we insert
the keyword distinct after select. We can rewrite the preceding query as: <br><br>
<h4>select distinct dept name
    from instructor</h4>
    <br><br>
<h4> -> All keyword</h4><br>
SQL allows us to use the keyword all to specify explicitly that duplicates are
not removed: <br><br>
<h4>select all dept name
    from instructor;</h4>
<br>
Since duplicate retention is the default, we shall not use all in our examples. To
ensure the elimination of duplicates in the results of our example queries, we
shall use distinct whenever it is necessary.
<br><br>
<h4>Attribute Specification in Select Clause
</h4>
<br>
The asterisk symbol “ * ” can be used in the select clause to denote “all attributes.”
Thus, the use of instructor.* in the select clause of the query:
<br><br>
<h4>select instructor.*
    from instructor, teaches
    where instructor.ID= teaches.ID;</h4><br>
indicates that all attributes of instructor are to be selected. A select clause of the
form select * indicates that all attributes of the result relation of the from clause
are selected
<br><br>


<h1>Null Values</h1>
Null values present special problems in relational operations, including arithmetic operations, comparison operations, and set operations. <br>
The result of an arithmetic expression (involving, for example +, −, ∗, or /) is
null if any of the input values is null. For example, if a query has an expression
r.A+ 5, and r.Ais null for a particular tuple, then the expression result must also
be null for that tuple. <br><br>
Comparisons involving nulls are more of a problem. For example, consider
the comparison “1 < null”. It would be wrong to say this is true since we do not
know what the null value represents. But it would likewise be wrong to claim this
expression is false; if we did, “not (1 < null)” would evaluate to true, which does
not make sense. SQL therefore treats as unknown the result of any comparison
involving a null value  <br><br>
This creates a third logical value in addition to true
and false.
Since the predicate in a where clause can involve Boolean operations such
as and, or, and not on the results of comparisons, the definitions of the Boolean
operations are extended to deal with the value unknown.
<br><b>• and: </b> The result of true and unknown is unknown, false and unknown is false,
while unknown and unknown is unknown.
<br><b>• or:</b> The result of true or unknown is true, false or unknown is unknown, while
unknown or unknown is unknown.
<br><b>• or:</b> The result of not unknown is unknown.
<br><br>



<h1>Pattern Matching</h1>
SQL also permits a variety of functions on character strings, such as concatenating (using “||”), extracting substrings, finding the length of strings, converting <br>
strings to uppercase (using the function upper(s) where s is a string) and lowercase (using the function lower(s)), removing spaces at the end of the string
(using trim(s)) and so on. <br>
There are variations on the exact set of string functions
supported by different database systems. See your database system’s manual for
more details on exactly what string functions it supports. <br>
Pattern matching can be performed on strings, using the operator like. We
describe patterns by using two special characters: <br><br>
<br>
<h4>• Percent (%):</h4> The % character matches any substring.
<br>
<h4>• Percent (_):</h4> The character matches any character. <br><br>
Patterns are case sensitive; that is, uppercase characters do not match lowercase
characters, or vice versa. To illustrate pattern matching, we consider the following
examples: 
<br> • ’Intro%’ matches any string beginning with “Intro”.
<br> • ’%Comp%’ matches any string containing “Comp” as a substring, for example, ’Intro. to Computer Science’, and ’Computational Biology’.
<br> • ’ ’ matches any string of exactly three characters.
<br> • ’ %’ matches any string of at least three characters.
<br> SQL expresses patterns by using the like comparison operator. Consider the query
“Find the names of all departments whose building name includes the substring
‘Watson’.” 
<br><br> This query can be written as:
<br>
<h4>select dept name
    from department
    where building like ’%Watson%’;
    </h4>
<br><br>




<h1>Ordering Results</h1>
<h4>Ordering the Display of Tuples</h4>
<br>
 SQL offers the user some control over the order in which tuples in a relation
are displayed. The order by clause causes the tuples in the result of a query to
appear in sorted order. To list in alphabetic order all instructors in the Physics
department, we write:

By default, the order by clause lists items in ascending order. To specify the
sort order, we may specify desc for descending order or asc for ascending order.
Furthermore, <br><br>
<h4>select name
    from instructor
    where dept name = ’Physics’
    order by name;</h4>
<br><br> ordering can be performed on multiple attributes. Suppose that we
wish to list the entire instructor relation in descending order of salary. If several instructors have the same salary, we order them in ascending order by name. <br>
We express this query in SQL as follows:
<br><br>
<h4>select *
    from instructor
    order by salary desc, name asc;</h4>
<br><br>



<h1>Aggregate Functions</h1>
Aggregate functions are functions that take a collection (a set or multiset) of values
as input and return a single value. SQL offers five built-in aggregate functions:
<br>
<h4>• Average: avg</h4>
<br>
<h4>• Minimum: min</h4>
<br>
<h4>• Maximum: max</h4>
<br>
<h4>• Total: sum</h4>
<br>
<h4>• Count: count</h4>
<br>
The input to sum and avg must be a collection of numbers, but the other operators
can operate on collections of nonnumeric data types, such as strings, as well.
<br><br>
Basic Aggregation
Consider the query “Find the average salary of instructors in the Computer Science department.” <br>
We write this query as follows:
<br><br>
<h4>select avg (salary)
    from instructor
    where dept name= ’Comp. Sci.’;</h4>
<br><br>
The result of this query is a relation with a single attribute, containing a single
tuple with a numerical value corresponding to the average salary of instructors
in the Computer Science department. The database system may give an arbitrary
name to the result relation attribute that is generated by aggregation; <br>
however, we can give a meaningful name to the attribute by using the as clause as follows:
<br><br>
<h4>select avg (salary) as avg salary
    from instructor
    where dept name= ’Comp. Sci.’;</h4>
<br><br>




<h1>Views</h1>
Any such relation that is not part of the logical model, but is made visible to a
user as a virtual relation, is called a view. It is possible to support a large number
of views on top of any given set of actual relations. <br><br>
<h4>View Definition
</h4>
<br>
We define a view in SQL by using the create view command. To define a view, we
must give the view a name and must state the query that computes the view. The
<br><br>
<h4>form of the create view command is:
    create view v as <query expression>;</h4>
<br><br>
where <h4><query expression></query></h4> is any legal query expression. The view name is
    represented by v.
    Consider again the clerk who needs to access all data in the instructor relation,
    except salary. The clerk should not be authorized to access the instructor relation
    (we see later, in Section 4.6, how authorizations can be specified). <br>
    Instead, a view relation faculty can be made available to the clerk, with the view defined as
    follows:
    <br><br>
    <h4>create view faculty as
        select ID, name, dept name
        from instructor;</h4>
    <br><br>
    <h4>    Using Views in SQL Queries
    </h4>
    <br>
Once we have defined a view, we can use the view name to refer to the virtual
relation that the view generates. Using the view physics fall 2009, we can find
all Physics courses offered in the Fall 2009 semester in the Watson building by
writing:

View names may appear in a query any place where a relation name may appear,
The attribute names of a <br>
<br>
<h4>select course id
    from physics fall 2009
    where building= ’Watson’;</h4>
<br><br> 
view can be specified explicitly as follows:
<br><br>
<h4>create view departments total salary(dept name, total salary) as
    select dept name, sum (salary)
    from instructor
    group by dept name</h4>
<br><br>

<h1>Managing Privilages</h1>
We may assign a user several forms of authorizations on parts of the database.
Authorizations on data include:
<br><br>
<h4>• Authorization to read data.
</h4>
<br>
<h4>• Authorization to insert new data.
</h4> 
<br>
<h4>• Authorization to update data.
</h4>
<br>
<h4>• Authorization to update data.
</h4>
<br><br>
Each of these types of authorizations is called a <h4>privilege</h4>. We may authorize the
user all, none, or a combination of these types of privileges on specified parts of
a database, such as a relation or a view.
<br><br>
The SQL data-definition language includes commands to grant and revoke
privileges. The grant statement is used to confer authorization. <br>
The basic form of
this statement is:
<br><br>
<h4>grant (privilege list)<br>
    on (relation name or view name)<br>
    to (user/role list);</h4><br>
<br><br>
The select authorization on a relation is required to read tuples in the relation.
The following grant statement grants database users Amit and Satoshi select
authorization on the department relation:
<br><br>
<h4>grant select on department to Amit, Satoshi;
</h4>
<br><br>
To revoke an authorization, we use the revoke statement. It takes a form
almost identical to that of grant:
<br><br>
<h4>revoke (privilege list) <br>
    on (relation name or view name) <br>
    from (user/role list); <br></h4>
<br><br>
Thus, to revoke the privileges that we granted previously, we write
<br><br>
<h4>revoke select on department from Amit, Satoshi;
</h4>
<br>Revocation of privileges is more complex if the user from whom the privilege
is revoked has granted the privilege to another user.
<br><br>

<h1>Transactions</h1>
A transaction consists of a sequence of query and/or update statements. The SQL
standard specifies that a transaction begins implicitly when an SQL statement is
executed. One of the following SQL statements must end the transaction:
<br><br>
<h4>• Commit work</h4> commits the current transaction; that is, it makes the updates
performed by the transaction become permanent in the database. After the
transaction is committed, a new transaction is automatically started.
<br><br>
<h4>• Rollback work</h4> causes the current transaction to be rolled back; that is, it
undoes all the updates performed by the SQL statements in the transaction.
Thus, the database state is restored to what it was before the first statement
of the transaction was executed. <br><br>
The keyword work is optional in both the statements.
Transaction rollback is useful if some error condition is detected during execution of a transaction. Commit is similar, in a sense, to saving changes to a
document that is being edited, while rollback is similar to quitting the edit session without saving changes. Once a transaction has executed commit work, its
effects can no longer be undone by rollback work. The database system guarantees that in the event of some failure, such as an error in one of the SQL statements,
a power outage, or a system crash, a transaction’s effects will be rolled back if it
has not yet executed commit work. In the case of power outage or other system
crash, the rollback occurs when the system restarts.
