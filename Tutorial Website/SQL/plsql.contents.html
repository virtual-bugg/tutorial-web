    <h1>Overview</h1>
    With PL/SQL, you can use SQL statements to manipulate Oracle data and flow-of control statements to process the data. Moreover, you can declare constants and
variables, define procedures and functions, and trap runtime errors. Thus, PL/SQL
combines the data manipulating power of SQL with the data processing power of
procedural languages. <br>
A good way to get acquainted with PL/SQL is to look at a sample program. The
program below processes an order for tennis rackets. First, it declares a variable of
type NUMBER to store the quantity of tennis rackets on hand. Then, it retrieves the
quantity on hand from a database table named inventory. If the quantity is
greater than zero, the program updates the table and inserts a purchase record into
another table named purchase_record. Otherwise, the program inserts an out of-stock record into the purchase_record table.

<h5>
    <h4>DECLARE</h4><br>
 qty_on_hand NUMBER(5); <br>
<h4>BEGIN</h4> <br>
 SELECT quantity INTO qty_on_hand FROM inventory <br>
 WHERE product = ’TENNIS RACKET’<br>
 FOR UPDATE OF quantity; <br>
 IF qty_on_hand > 0 THEN -- check quantity <br>
 UPDATE inventory SET quantity = quantity - 1 <br>
 WHERE product = ’TENNIS RACKET’; <br>
 INSERT INTO purchase_record <br>
 VALUES (’Tennis racket purchased’, SYSDATE); <br>
 ELSE <br>
 INSERT INTO purchase_record <br>
 VALUES (’Out of tennis rackets’, SYSDATE); <br>
 END IF; <br>
 COMMIT;<br>
<h4>END;</h4><br>

    <h1>Block Structure</h1><br>
    PL/SQL is a block-structured language. That is, the basic units (procedures,
functions, and anonymous blocks) that make up a PL/SQL program are logical
blocks, which can contain any number of nested sub-blocks. Typically, each logical
block corresponds to a problem or subproblem to be solved. Thus, PL/SQL
supports the divide-and- conquer approach to problem solving called stepwise
refinement <br><br>
A block (or sub-block) lets you group logically related declarations and statements.
That way, you can place declarations close to where they are used. The declarations
are local to the block and cease to exist when the block completes.A PL/SQL block has three parts: <h4>a declarative part, an
    executable part, and an exception-handling part.</h4> (In PL/SQL, a warning or error
condition is called an exception.) Only the executable part is required. <br><br>
The order of the parts is logical. First comes the declarative part, in which items can
be declared. Once declared, items can be manipulated in the executable part.
Exceptions raised during execution can be dealt with in the exception-handling
part. <br>

You can nest sub-blocks in the executable and exception-handling parts of a
PL/SQL block or subprogram but not in the declarative part. Also, you can define
local subprograms in the declarative part of any block. However, you can call local
subprograms only from the block in which they are defined<br><br>
    <h1>Architechture</h1>
    The PL/SQL runtime system is a technology, not an independent product. Think of
this technology as an engine that executes PL/SQL blocks and subprograms. The
engine can be installed in an Oracle server or in an application development tool
such as Oracle Forms or Oracle Reports. So, PL/SQL can reside in two
environments: <br><br>
<h4>-> The Oracle server</h4>
<br>
<h4>-> Oracle tools</h4>
<br> <br>
These two environments are independent. PL/SQL might be available in the Oracle
server but unavailable in tools, or the other way around. In either environment, the
PL/SQL engine accepts as input any valid PL/SQL block or subprogram.
The PL/SQL engine processing an anonymous block. The engine
executes procedural statements but sends SQL statements to the SQL Statement
Executor in the Oracle server. <br><br>
<img src="../IMAGES/sql/img1.png" alt=""> <br><br>
<h3>In the Oracle Server
</h3>
Application development tools that lack a local PL/SQL engine must rely on
Oracle to process PL/SQL blocks and subprograms. When it contains the PL/SQL
engine, an Oracle server can process PL/SQL blocks and subprograms as well as
single SQL statements. The Oracle server passes the blocks and subprograms to its
local PL/SQL engine. <br><br>
<h4>Anonymous Blocks </h4>
    Anonymous PL/SQL blocks can be embedded in an Oracle Precompiler or OCI
    program. At run time, the program, lacking a local PL/SQL engine, sends these
    blocks to the Oracle server, where they are compiled and executed. Likewise,
    interactive tools such as SQL*Plus and Enterprise Manager, lacking a local PL/SQL
    engine, must send anonymous blocks to Oracle. <br><br>
<h4>Stored Subprograms</h4>
Subprograms can be compiled separately and stored permanently in an Oracle
database, ready to be executed. A subprogram explicitly CREATEd using an Oracle
tool is called a stored subprogram. Once compiled and stored in the data dictionary,
it is a schema object, which can be referenced by any number of applications
connected to that database. <br>
Stored subprograms defined within a package are called packaged subprograms;
those defined independently are called stand-alone subprograms. (Subprograms
defined within another subprogram or within a PL/SQL block are called local
subprograms. They cannot be referenced by other applications and exist only for
the convenience of the enclosing block.) <br><br>
<br><br>

    
<h1>Variable & Constants</h1>
PL/SQL allows you to declare constants and variables, then use them in SQL and
procedural statements anywhere an expression can be used. However, forward
references are not allowed. So, you must declare a constant or variable before
referencing it in other statements, including other declarative statements. <br><br>
<h4>Declaring Variables</h4><br><br>
    Variables can have any SQL datatype, such as CHAR, DATE, and NUMBER, or any
    PL/SQL datatype, such as BOOLEAN and BINARY_INTEGER. For example, assume
    that you want to declare a variable named part_no to hold 4-digit numbers and a
    variable named in_stock to hold the Boolean value TRUE or FALSE. You declare
    these variables as follows:
<br>
<h4>part_no NUMBER(4); <br>
    in_stock BOOLEAN;</h4>

<br><br>
<h4>Assigning Values to a Variable</h4>
<br><br>
You can assign values to a variable in two ways. The first way uses the assignment
operator (:=), a colon followed by an equal sign. You place the variable to the left
of the operator and an expression to the right. Some examples follow:
<br><br>
<h4>tax := price * tax_rate; <br>
    bonus := current_salary * 0.10; <br>
    amount := TO_NUMBER(SUBSTR(’750 dollars’, 1, 3)); <br>
    valid := FALSE;</h4>
<br><br>
<h4>Declaring Constants</h4>
<br><br>
Declaring a constant is like declaring a variable except that you must add the
keyword CONSTANT and immediately assign a value to the constant. Thereafter, no
more assignments to the constant are allowed. In the following example, you
declare a constant named credit_limit: <br><br>
<h4>credit_limit CONSTANT REAL := 5000.00;
</h4>
<br><br>
    <h1>Data Types</h1>
    Every constant and variable has a datatype, which specifies a storage format,
constraints, and valid range of values. PL/SQL provides a variety of predefined
datatypes. A scalar type has no internal components. A composite type has internal
components that can be manipulated individually. A reference type holds values,
called pointers, that designate other program items. A LOB type holds values, called
locators, that specify the location of large objects (graphic images for example)
stored out-of-line. <br><br>
